Make sure to add the .outline class to your outline svg icons when using them in your web project:

<svg class="icon outline"><use href="#name" xlink:href="#name"/></svg>

If you have organized icons in a Nucleo project, you can copy the svg code directly from the project page. You can read more about that on our Documentation page:
